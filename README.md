For me to get my footing in github

Hello. My name is Ryan Neumann.

I'm a student at Reed College interested in some programming opportunities. I've learned C++, java, Python,Go and SML and I'm sure I could pick up any C-like language in a short time. I've never used github, I'm here to see where it can take me.
